Project Overview
The Core Kingdom Engine simulates a dynamic medieval kingdom where players manage various aspects of governance, such as:

Managing social classes (peasants, merchants, nobles).
Growing and maintaining the population.
Training and feeding the army.
Handling economic decisions like taxation and inflation.
Managing banking systems, loans, and audits.
Gathering and consuming resources like food, wood, stone, and iron.
Responding to random events like famine, disease, and war.
The project emphasizes advanced OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, exception handling, and dynamic memory management.
